# 6G Power Domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (PD-NOMA) Simulation

This repository contains simulation and analysis tools for 6G Power Domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access systems. The project implements various power allocation algorithms, user pairing strategies, and performance comparison between OMA and NOMA techniques.

## Key Features
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN)** for optimal power allocation
- **K-means clustering** for intelligent user pairing
- **Performance analysis** comparing OMA vs NOMA systems
- **Visualization tools** for rate and power allocation analysis
- **C++ and Python** implementations for efficient simulation

## Structure
- `/21May/` - Latest simulation models and AI-based algorithms
- `/Pairing/` - User pairing algorithms and clustering methods
- `/output/` - Simulation results and data files

Run simulations using the provided Python scripts or compile C++ files for performance-critical operations.
